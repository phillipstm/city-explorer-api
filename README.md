## Overview

The problem domain is setting up the backend of our website

## Getting Started

Create a new repo called `city-explorer-api` on GitHub, initialized with a README file. Clone it locally, and do all your work on a meaningfully-named feature branch off of `main`.

Run the command `npm init` to create a new project. Answer the prompts with reasonable answers, or just hit enter to accept the defaults. Review the `package.json` file that it creates for you, and edit it if desired.

Use `npm install` to add the required dependencies to this project: `express`, `dotenv`, and `cors`.

Manually add the remaining files identified in the folder tree above. Put appropriate content into `.gitignore` and `.eslintrc.json`.

Copy the contents of [weather.json](https://codefellows.github.io/code-301-guide/curriculum/class-07/lab/starter-code/data/weather.json) and paste it into your (otherwise empty) local `/data/weather.json`.

Set the contents of .env to set a value for `PORT`. Ensure `.env` is in your `.gitignore` file.

Populate your `README.md` file with the template provided in the lab.
